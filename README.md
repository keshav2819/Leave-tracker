leave tracker records
Today first sign in the sharepoint and after that starts my task that is to create basic pages and list for understanding.
After that,create the list which name "Leave Tracker" inside the sites contents.Then create two list that is "Leave master
list" and "Holiday_list_MD".Inside "Leave Master list" creates some column like employee id,employee name,leave type,start
date,end date and approval status and insert values on these column.
    Similarly,in "Holiday_list_MD" creates column like Holiday id,holiday name,holiday date,region/location and insert value
on these column.
